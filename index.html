<div id=df>
Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen<br>
 on April 4, 1975, to develop and <br>
sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. <br>
It rose to dominate the personal computer<br>
 operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s,<br>
 followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial<br>
 public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share <br>
price created three billionaires <br>
and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft<br>
 employees. Since the 1990s, it has<br>
 increasingly diversified from the operating system <br>
market and has made several corporate
 acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of<br>
 Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in<br>
 October 2023,[3] followed by its acquisition of LinkedIn<br>
 for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[4] and <br>
its acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.<br>

produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops,<br>
 tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services<br>
market through MSN mixed reality (HoloLens), <br>
cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).<br>
